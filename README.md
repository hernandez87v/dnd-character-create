### Dungeons and Dragons Character Creator

The DnD Character Creator is an app that allows for the creation of characters, and viewing of previously created stats. A user can also make attack, and initiative rolls.

The app was built with a React front end, and an express backend. Our database uses Postgres, and was hosted on ElephantSQL throughout development.

1. Clone this Repo
2. Create a postgres database instance. Run the schema files in order, followed by the seed files, also in order.
3. Enter credentials from your created database into the .env file 
4. In outermost project folder, run npm i to install dependencies
5. Open 2 terminal windows, and cd into react-front-end in one, and express-back-end in the other. Run npm start in both.
